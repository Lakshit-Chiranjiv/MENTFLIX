            </dd>
            <br><br>
            <dt>4. Learn to Deal with Stress</dd>
            <dd>Like it or not, stress is a part of life. Practice good coping skills: Try One-Minute Stress Strategies, 
                do Tai Chi, exercise, yoga, take a nature walk, play with your pet or try journal writing as a stress reducer.

            <dt>6. Set realestic goals</dt>
            <dd>Decide what you want to achieve academically, professionally and personally, and write down the steps you need to
                 realize your goals. Aim high, but be realistic and don't over-schedule. You'll enjoy a tremendous sense of
                  accomplishment and self-worth as you progress toward your goal. Wellness Coaching,

            <dt>7. Break up the Monotony</dt>
            <dd>
                Although our routines make us more efficient and enhance our feelings of security and safety, a little change of 
                pace can perk up a tedious schedule. Alter your jogging route, plan a road-trip, take a walk in a different park, 
                hang some new pictures or try a new restaurant.
            </dd>
            <br><br>
            <dt>8. Avoid Alcohol and other drugs</dt>
            <dd>
                Keep alcohol use to a minimum and avoid other drugs. Sometimes people use alcohol and other drugs to "self-medicate" 
                but in reality, alcohol and other drugs only aggravate problems.
            </dd>
            <br><br>
            <dt>9. Get Help when Needed</dt>
            <dd>
                It's the most importnat point, seeking help is a sign of strength â€” not a weakness. And it is important to remember that treatment is effective. 
                People who get appropriate care can recover from mental illness and addiction and lead full, rewarding lives. See Resources for 
                Stress and Mental Health for campus and community resources.
